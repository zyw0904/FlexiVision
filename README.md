## Introduction
`videopipeplus` is a intelligent video analytics framework for edge heterogeneous devices, written in C++. It has three key advantages: high hardware adaptability, low development barriers, and external hardware integration. The framework utilizes a modular design to support various edge hardware acceleration devices, allowing flexible adaptation to resource-constrained edge environments. Its model conversion module facilitates cross-device model portability, simplifying deployment. Additionally, the graphical development environment enables users to quickly build video analysis pipelines through intuitive operations, significantly lowering the technical barrier. The framework also supports real-time interaction with external devices, enhancing automation and responsiveness. `Videopipeplus` can be used to build different types of video analysis applications, suitable for scenarios such as video structuring, image search, face recognition, and behavior analysis in many fields.
