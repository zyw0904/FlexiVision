* ##########################################
* how does frame meta work?
* ##########################################
* frame meta, holding all data(targets/elements/...) of current frame in the video scene. frame meta are independent and don't know about each other, neither its previous frames nor next frames.
* the data in frame meta is just telling us what **current frame** is so we can not get something like 'state-switch' from a single frame meta. 
* if you need know when the 'state-switch' happen, for example, you want to notify to cloud via restful api if state changed(ignore if it's keeping), 
* you need cache previous frame meta(maybe partial data) in your custom node first and then compare with each other to figure out if it has changed.
* 
* frame meta works like our eyes, by taking a glance at the frame in video we can see what the picture is and how many targets are there.
* but if you want to  know something like state-switch, for example, a person was walking and then stop or it stop for a while and then start to walk, you have to see(cache) more frames.
* 
* see more implementation of 'vp_track_node' and 'vp_message_broker_node' which saved history frame meta data and then work based on them.
* 1. vp_track_node          : save previous locations of targets and then do tracking based on them, we need see more frames to track targets in video.
* 2. vp_message_broker_node : save previous ba_flags and then do notifying based on them, we need see more frames to check if state-switch has happened.
